# weather-dashboard

## Description 

This weather dashboard is used to give the user not only the current weather but the next five days weather forecast. A big inconveniece of weather apps is that it shows you one city's weather on one page. To make it easy for the user we save their past searcehes to allow mulitple locations without having to leave the page. 
On the site it is visually easy to understand because next to the weather condition there are icons that showcase the weather.
